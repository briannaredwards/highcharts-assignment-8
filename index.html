<h1>How Americans Spend Their Time</h1>

<p>By Brianna Edwards</p>

<p>American adults have a wide variety of choices for how to spend their time. The 24-hour day is often broken up into sleep, work and leisure. Every year, the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> takes surveys to evaluate how Americans spend their time and document the changes year to year. The 2018 <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/atus.pdf">survey</a> found that American adults spend, on average, 8.82 hours sleeping. View the chart below to see how they spent their time while awake.</p>
